# Technical test task

for React front-end developer (with Java backend skills)
\*The completed task will be checked for the presence of AI. Don't deceive yourself.
It's important for us to understand your real skills.
‚Ä¢ Objective: Develop a simplified version of a web application. Your task will involve building
both the front-end and a basic back-end component.

_**1. Front-end (React & TypeScript)
‚Ä¢ Feature: Create a dashboard that displays ad performance metrics. The dashboard should
contain one of the visualizations (for example: a bar graph / line graph / pie chart).
‚Ä¢ Requirements:
o Use React for building the front-end.
o Utilize TypeScript for all components.
o Implement state management appropriately.
o Add basic navigation between different sections of the dashboard (e.g., Home,
About, Dashboard).**_

2. Back-end (Java & Spring Boot)
   ‚Ä¢ Feature: Develop a simple RESTful API using Java and Spring Boot that provides the data
   for the front-end visualizations.
   ‚Ä¢ Requirements:
   o Create endpoints to fetch advertising data (you can use mock data).
   o Implement basic error handling and data validation.

3. Integration
   ‚Ä¢ Connect the front-end and back-end, ensuring that data fetched from the Java API is
   properly displayed in the React components.

4. Bonus (Optional)
   ‚Ä¢ Implement unit tests for back-end components.

_**‚Ä¢ Add features like sorting or filtering the data on the dashboard.
Submission Guidelines
‚Ä¢ Submit your code via a GitHub repository link.
‚Ä¢ Ensure the repository is public.
‚Ä¢ Include a brief video that demonstrates the functionality of the application and any special
features or considerations.**_
